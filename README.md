## Features üéâ

### üêê **Antispam**
Proxima helps you keep your chat clean and free from spammy behavior. It detects when a user is sending too many messages within a short time frame and automatically takes action to prevent spamming. Depending on your configuration, Proxima can:

With this feature, Proxima ensures that your community is free from disruptive behavior while maintaining a friendly environment.

Proxima gives you the ability to execute **shell commands** directly from the chat. This is incredibly useful for system administrators or advanced users who need to interact with their server without leaving the chat. Some common use cases include:
- **Server Monitoring**: Check the health of your server or retrieve system status information directly from the chat.
- **Automation**: Run commands to automate server tasks or retrieve logs in real-time.
